* licence info?

This self-study hands-on material, to be prepared *before* the one-week
module (31 August -- 4 September 2020), consists of two parts:

- **Tutorials** covering the R programming skills required during the hands-on 
  sessions. Depending on your current experience with R, you might be able to 
  skip parts of this material. Below, an overview on the tutorial content is given.
- **Tasks** (hands-on) based on Wilhelm's screencasts. This material is 
  mandatory. *Zoom meeting about the tasks before the module?*

The following topics are covered in the R tutorials:
